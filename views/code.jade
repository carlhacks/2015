      | Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy
      | to other participants throughout the event.
    p
      | To make clear what is expected, all participants, mentors, sponsors,
      | organizers, and volunteers at CarlHacks are required to conform to the

      | throughout the event.
    h2 The Short Version
    p

      | experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
      | disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do
      | not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
    p
      | All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
      | including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
      | imagery is not appropriate for any CarlHacks venue, including bussing.
    p
      | Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
      | Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
      | exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for CarlHacks.
    p
      | Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference
      | without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
    p Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
    h2 The Longer Version
    p
      | Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual
      | orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      | religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
      | stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
      | disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
      | and unwelcome sexual attention.
    p
      | Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
      | comply immediately.
    p
      | Mentors, sponsors, volunteers, and anyone at the event in any capacity
      | are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
      | attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
      | material. Mentors, sponsors, and volunteers should not use sexualized
      | clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
      | environment.
    p
      | Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,
