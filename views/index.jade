      p
        | We are excited to host a large-scale hackathon at a small
        | midwestern liberal arts college, and to bring an inclusive
        | liberal arts perspective to the world of hackathons. Whether
        | you have a passion for graphic design or a penchant for systems,
        | your skills and ideas can help create something truly powerful.
        | That’s the essence of the liberal arts perspective—diverse backgrounds
        | often produce the most impressive results.

        strong What will you create?

      p
        | [...explain hackathons].
        | At CarlHacks, <strong>any student who is or was enrolled in an undergraduate
        | collegiate institution during the 2014–2015 academic year</strong> is eligible
        | to participate in <strong>teams of 2–5</strong>. You don’t even need previous hackathon
        | experience—hackathons are great opportunities for learning new skills,
        | as well as honing old ones. We’ll have sponsors and mentors on-site for
        | old and new hackers alike to expand their coding abilities, enabling you
        | to grow skills and make connections with companies and developers in the
        | field. Whether you choose to submit a project for judging or not, you’ll
        | leave CarlHacks with more tools to make your future ideas a reality.
      p
        | <strong>You will need to bring your laptop, charger, your student ID card</strong>, and hardware if
        | you’re wishing to do a hardware hack. It is also strongly recommended that you bring
        | toiletries, a change of clothing, and a sleeping bag. You don’t need to have a project
        | idea before the hackathon begins—some of the best ideas happen during hackathons, not
        | before. You don’t even need a set team before the hackathon! Many people will come without
        | teams, and we will facilitate a “speed-dating” period to help single hackers form teams at
        | the beginning of the event.
      h1 The Venue
      p
        | CarlHacks will be held in the Carleton College Recreation Center Fieldhouse. This space
        | has showers, sinks, and bathrooms on-site, and boasts a space that can house all 400 hackers
        | (and sponsors). The Rec Center is also mere steps from Carleton’s 880 acre arboretum, providing
        | a convenient venue for outdoor adventures if you need a break from your computer screen.
