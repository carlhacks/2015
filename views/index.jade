      h1 Event Details
      p
        | Hosted by Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, CarlHacks is a 36-hour overnight event where teams work
        | together to build interesting apps, websites, games, and other projects.
      p
        | <strong>Any student who is or was enrolled in an undergraduate
        | collegiate institution during the 2014&ndash;2015 academic year is eligible
        | to participate in teams of 2&ndash;5</strong>.
        | You don’t need past coding experience to participate. Hackathons are a great opportunity
        | to learn new skills or hone old ones, and whether you’re a graphic designer or a dedicated
        | Python enthusiast (or both!), you can make an important contribution to a CarlHacks project.
        | Teams may choose to submit their projects for judging and prizes will be awarded
        | to the best projects in a variety of categories. Even if you choose not to submit
        | your project for judging, you’ll leave CarlHacks with tools to make your
        | future aspirations a reality.

      h2 The Venue
      p
        | The Carleton College Recreation Center Fieldhouse has showers, sinks, bathrooms, and a
        | bouldering wall, and boasts enough space for 200 hackers plus our sponsors.
        | The Rec Center is also mere steps from Carleton’s 880-acre arboretum, offering
        | a convenient venue for outdoor adventures when you need a break from your screen.

      h2 What to Bring
      p
        | CarlHacks is completely free to attend, and we'll provide meals, showers, and air beds for napping.
        | <strong>You will need to bring your laptop, charger, student ID card</strong>, and any hardware
        | you intend to use in your hack. Toiletries, shower shoes, a change of clothing, and a pillow
        | are strongly recommended. A project idea is not needed beforehand&mdash;some of the best ideas happen
        | during hackathons, not before. Don't worry if you don't have a team since we will facilitate a “speed-dating”
        | period to help hackers form teams at the beginning of the event.

      p
        | Representatives from our sponsors will also be present at the event, manning tables around the perimeter
        | and circulating through the project areas. This is a wonderful opportunity to talk with current employees
        | or plan a future interview. More info on sponsors and workshop schedules will be available as the event approaches.
