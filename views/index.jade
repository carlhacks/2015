          Hackathons are fast-paced events in which small teams work to
          implement an idea.
          The projects are usually software-oriented.
          Hackathons are often organized by tech companies and by universities, and
          typically involve large quanities of junk food and caffeinated beverages.
          The largest college hackathons attract as many as a thousand students and
          give out thousands of dollars in prizes.

            Projects will be judged on the criteria of usefulness,
            innovation, and presentation. Presentations on Saturday will be
            the sole basis for the judging.
          li.lead.
            You can start planning now but all code relating to your project
            must be written at the event, with the exception of any publicly available
            resources. You are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to take advantage
            of open source libraries and technologies.
